# Hacking with Swift
This is the source code to accompany the projects at [hackingwithswift.com](http://www.hackingwithswift.com), a free tutorial series that teaches Swift coding for iOS.

All projects should be compatible with Xcode 6.2 and iOS 8, but will be updated to Swift 1.2 compatibility when Xcode 6.3 is finalised. Where appropriate, separate project files have been provided so that you can follow the tutorial from scratch without having to dig around in the completed project folder.

If you have questions, you can find me on Twitter [@twostraws](http://www.twitter.com/twostraws).
